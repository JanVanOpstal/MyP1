## MyP1
MyP1 is an attempt to create a more clean sollution for my current ESP32 P1 reader project.
It's now in it's beginning phase, but the following goals are set:
* It should capture the telegrams and send them to an open-dsmr instance
* It should simulate a Shelly a Shelly Pro 3EM for 3 phase communication to a Marstek battery
